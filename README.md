# Computer-Vision
This repository contains my works related to **Computer Vision**.

## Works/Projects

### 1. [Color Detection](https://github.com/MashodRana/Computer-Vision/tree/master/color_detection)
This project is about how to detect color present in an image through Unsupervised learning.
### 2. [Extraction of interior pixel values of a contour](https://github.com/MashodRana/Computer-Vision/tree/master/contour_pixels)
How we can extract pixel values of contours of an image.

### 3. [Digit Recognizer: CNN with TensorFlow](https://www.kaggle.com/mashodrana/digit-recognition)
#### Digit Recognition
I build a classfier with **Convolution Neural Network** which classify digit images. Keras of **TnesorFlow** is used in this work.
